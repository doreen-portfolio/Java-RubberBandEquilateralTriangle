Java Rubber Band Equilateral Triangle
=========

This Java application was part of an assignment for an introductory programming methods course at BCIT (COMP 1510 Programming Methods). It draws an equilateral triangle; its size and orientation is determined by a mouse drag. The original mouse press location is the centre, and the dragged position of the mouse is one of the corners. 

Additional features:
* Blue squares are drawn around each point of the triangle.
* The coordinates and a message of mouse pressed, mouse released, and mouse dragging appears in the top left of the corner.
* The centre circle is drawn in red for the initial mouse click.
* The lines of the triangle are dashed and blue in colour.
